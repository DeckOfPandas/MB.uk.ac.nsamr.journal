## Year, Volume, Issue

* The Volume number increases each year, and the issue number resets everytime a new volume is started.
* Issue 2 is technically a continuation of Issue 1, and therefore the page number for Issue 2 continues from when Issue 1 ended. E.g. Last page of volume 1 = 33, first page of volume 2 = 34.

## Metadata
* All meta data is present and the same as in the pdf version.
* Page numbers are not separated by a single hyphen here `-`, not a double hyphen as in the LaTeX document `--`.
* URL is in the format: `Year-volume-issue-authorsurname`. E.g. `2018-1-1-byrne`
 * For multiple submissions by the same author in the same issue add the number afterwards. e.g. `2018-1-1-byrne-2`. Do not add `-1` to the first submission by that author.
 
## Online abstract
* All code is removed from online abstract, and all figures render correctly, you may need to use makeshift symbols or type out characters in full if they do not render.
