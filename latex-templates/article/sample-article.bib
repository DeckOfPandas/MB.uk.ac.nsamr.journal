  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The first objective of the study was to determine whether
	there were any consistent differences in the electrophysiological
	spread of excitation (SOE) function, as measured using the electrically
	evoked compound action potential (ECAP), between dual and single
	electrode stimulation with the Nucleus Freedom cochlear implant system.
	Dual electrode stimulation is produced by electrically coupling two
	adjacent single electrodes. The second objective was to determine
	whether there were any relationships between the SOE functions and
	psychophysically measured pitch ranking of dual and single electrodes.
	DESIGN: Nine adult cochlear implant subjects participated in the
	study. ECAPs for dual and single electrode stimulation were measured
	using the forward masking paradigm, as also used in the Neural Response
	Telemetry (NRT) software with the Nucleus implant. Research software
	was used to generate the dual and single electrode stimuli and record
	the ECAPs. Spread of excitations (SOEs) were measured on a dual electrode
	and the two adjacent single electrodes, at three positions on the
	array: apical, mid, and basal. Compared were the ECAP amplitudes
	at the peak of the SOE functions, the widths of the scaled SOE functions
	at the 75% point, and the electrode positions at the peak of the
	SOE function and at the 75%, 50%, and 25% points on apical and basal
	sides of the scaled functions. Pitch ranking was measured for the
	same sets of dual and single electrodes. A two-alternative forced
	choice procedure was used, with the electrodes in each set paired
	with each other as AB and BA pairs. The subject indicated which of
	the two stimuli had the higher pitch. RESULTS: Dual electrode SOEs
	could be successfully obtained using the same methods as used to
	measure single electrode SOEs. The shapes of the dual and single
	electrodes SOEs were similar. There was a trend of a higher ECAP
	amplitude for the dual electrode at the peak of the SOE function,
	but this was only significant for two comparisons at the apical and
	basal positions. There were no significant differences in the SOE
	widths between dual and single electrodes. The electrodes at the
	peak of the SOE function and on the apical and basal sides of the
	function at the 75% position were, in most cases, tonotopically ordered.
	At the 50% and 25% positions, there were fewer significant differences
	between the dual and single electrodes The pitch ranking results
	showed that in 74% of cases, the single and dual electrodes at each
	position were successfully ranked in the expected tonotopic order.
	There were no statistically significant correlations between the
	pitch ranking results and the ordering of electrodes on the SOE functions.
	CONCLUSIONS: Dual electrode stimulation produced similar SOE functions
	as single electrode stimulation. A tonotopic ordering of electrodes
	at the peak of the SOE and on the sides of the functions was found,
	but this was not statistically related to the pitch ranking results.
	SUMMARY: Electrophysiological spread of neural excitation (SOE) and
	pitch perception using dual and single electrodes was investigated
	in nine subjects using the Nucleus Freedom cochlear implant. Dual
	electrodes are produced by electrically coupling two adjacent single
	electrodes. The dual and single electrodes SOEs were similar in shape.
	Higher electrophysiological response amplitudes were generally found
	for the dual electrodes. There were no differences in SOE widths
	between dual and single electrodes. In three quarters of cases, dual
	and single electrodes were successfully pitch ranked in the expected
	tonotopic order. No significant relationships between pitch ranking
	and the SOE functions were found.}

	demonstrating a fast-acting compression which operates on a cycle-by-cycle
	basis. Using stimuli consisting of the 2nd-20th harmonics of 100
	Hz, they collected two types of data, forward masking of a pure tone

	phase stimuli are sometimes characterized by a more peaky envelope
	in the internal representation than are negative Schroeder phase
	stimuli, because of the phase response of the basilar membrane [Kohlrausch

	nonlinear compression, and hence results in less forward masking
	and lower perceived loudness. Carlyon and Datta used stimuli which
	greatly exceed a critical bandwidth. Because of this it is not obvious
	that their data reflect within-channel processing. Data reported
	here were collected using stimuli with a bandwidth more comparable
	to a critical bandwidth (40-59th harmonics of 25 Hz), and the peakiness
	of these stimuli was controlled directly, tones being either in cosine

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: Binaural hearing has been shown to support better speech
	perception in normal-hearing listeners than can be achieved with
	monaural stimulus presentation, particularly under noisy listening
	conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether bilateral
	electrical stimulation could confer similar benefits for cochlear
	implant listeners. DESIGN:: A total of 26 postlingually deafened
	adult patients with short duration of deafness were implanted at
	five centers and followed up for 1 yr. Subjects received MED-EL COMBI
	40+ devices bilaterally; in all but one case, implantation was performed
	in a single-stage surgery. Speech perception testing included CNC
	words in quiet and CUNY sentences in noise. Target speech was presented
	at the midline (0 degrees), and masking noise, when present, was
	presented at one of three simulated source locations along the azimuth
	(-90, 0, and +90 degrees). RESULTS:: Benefits of bilateral electrical
	stimulation were observed under conditions in which the speech and
	masker were spatially coincident and conditions in which they were
	spatially separated. Both the "head shadow" and "summation" effects
	were evident from the outset. Benefits consistent with "binaural
	squelch" were not reliably observed until 1 yr after implantation.
	CONCLUSIONS:: These results support a growing consensus that bilateral
	implantation provides functional benefits beyond those of unilateral
	implantation. Longitudinal data suggest that some aspects of binaural
	processing continue to develop up to 1 yr after implantation. The
	squelch effect, often reported as absent or rare in previous studies
	of bilateral cochlear implantation, was present for most subjects
	at the 1 yr measurement interval.}

	coinciding with masker modulation minima. Stimuli were monosyllabic
	words masked by speech-shaped noise, and masker modulation was introduced
	via multiplication with a raised sinusoid of 2.5-40 Hz. Tasks included
	detection, three-alternative forced-choice identification, and open-set

	also differed as a function of task; whereas low modulation rates
	were associated with best performance for the detection and three-alternative
	identification tasks, performance improved with modulation rate in
	the open-set task. This task-by-rate interaction was also observed

	continously in phase with respect to the outer two. The sensation
	changes 4 times per second. The range of ∆f (frequency separation
	of adjacent components) over which phase effects were detectable
	was investigated as a function of L, the level of the side-bands
	re the carrier. Phase effects could not be heard for ∆f, which
	increased as L decreased. The lower limit is interpreted in terms
	of the masking of the side-bands by the centre component. No phase
	effect will be audible if the lower component plus CT is masked.
	The upper limit appears to correspond well with the audibility of
	the CT generated by the UPPER components. The author assumes that
	the phase effect results from the addition of the CT to the lowest
	component. The role of envelope detection is investigated using an
	AM tone and an AM white noise together. A change in the phases of
	the envelopes of the two signals does not change the power spectrum,
	but it can be audible. The highest modulation rate for which envelope
	effects can be detected is 200-300 Hz, for L = -6 dB, but the limit
	decreases to about 40 Hz for L = -20 to 26 dB. The author suggests
	that envelope detection only plays a role in the phase effects for
	low values of ∆f/fcar. Other effects can be accounted for by changes
	in the "internal spectrum".}

	fluctuations, enlarging these (by means of expansion) may improve
	speech intelligibility. Still, even if these signal-processing techniques
	prove useful in terms of speech intelligibility, practical application
	might be hindered by unacceptably low sound quality. Therefore, both
