# journal.nsamr.ac.uk
This is the git repo for the new Journal of the National Student Association of Medical Research
* JNSAMR index site: http://www.nsamr.ac.uk/journal/journal-index/index.php
* JNSAMR machinery site: http://www.nsamr.ac.uk/journal/journal-machinery/ojs-3.0.1/index.php/jnsamr

These sites are separate because [@DeckOfPandas](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas) couldn't get the OJS frontend to look super nice (hints welcome please).

## Journal software and design
JNSAMR is built using Open Journal Systems 3 (OJS 3): https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/
The codebase https://github.com/pkp/ojs is included as a submodule.
The journal index site uses Bootstrap 3: http://getbootstrap.com/

Documentation provided by PKP:
* User Guide: https://www.gitbook.com/book/pkp/ojs3/details
* Technical: https://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=OJS_Documentation
*	Reference: https://pkp.sfu.ca/files/docs/quickreference/quickreference.pdf

The "NSAMR" theme for OJS3 is child theme of the bootstrap3 extension of OJS3: https://github.com/NateWr/bootstrap3
The bootstrap3 codebase is included as a submodule.

NSAMR will contribute back to both OJS and bootstrap3, as well as to other Open Source frameworks ued here, via pull requests.

# Step-by_step(ish) instructions to get going

## Developing these sites locally
Developing locally requires you to build the sites, otherwise you'll just see raw code. You need the same frameworks that serve the live sites.

Building the journal index site locally only requires you to serve the PHP:
<pre><code>php -S localhost:9999</code></pre>  

Building the journal machinery site locally needs a little more effort, because you need to serve the PHP from top of a local database. Here are some pointers:  
* Building requires an AMP stack (Apache, MySQL, PHP): download MAMP (mac): ([@https://www.mamp.info/en/](https://www.mamp.info/en/)) or WAMP if you have windows (ask the internet). If you're using ubuntu then...well, you don't need my hints.  
* Make a local database (either via command line or via PhpMyAdmin, which is linked to on the start page of MAMP)  
* $ojs_install_folder/config.php needs to contain the settings for the database underlying the current build (obviously), so you need to change these depending on which machine you're running on and what you've named the local database etc. The MAMP start page will helpfully display the settings for connecting to your database.  
* To make this easier to organise, for now there are two custom files included here as well as the bundled config.inc.php: config.inc.php.onza (for NSAMR-deployed clone) and config.inc.php.percy ([@DeckOfPandas](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas)' personal desktop machine). [@DeckOfPandas](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas) will delete the custom ones when more people are working on this.  
* There are certainly better ways of arranging this than the above, but [@DeckOfPandas](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas) is lazy.  
* Install OJS3 according to the instructions on the box  
* Make sure the folder "nsamr" is in plugins/themes/
* Navigate to journal admin panel (via localhost:your-port-number) and activate the plugin "NSAMR theme" (Settings --> Website --> Plugins)
* Set the active theme to "NSAMR" (Settings --> Website --> Appearance)
* Revel in own brilliance  

### If stuck:
* When playing with the design of the OJS3 frontend on the machinery site, you need to delete the caches a lot because, well, Sass, I think.
<pre><code>rm -r \*.php \*.css HTML t_compile/\*.php</code></pre>  
* Sometimes you need to do this:  
  * Template files: Administration >> Clear Template Cache  
* If the mysql server won't start, try these things: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41309275/mysql-server-on-mamp-wont-start](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41309275/mysql-server-on-mamp-wont-start)  

## Live deployment
To NSAMR committee members: The JNSAMR website runs from a clone of this repo on NSAMR's shell server kindly hosted by Mythic Beasts. *Do not* edit files on that machine except by pulling from this git repo.

## Access
* These repositories are public  
* NSAMR's server has public key access to this repo, which requires a password to use ([@DeckOfPandas](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas) has this for now)  
* Helen's personal machines have public key access too  
* If you want to add one from another machine, send [@DeckOfPandas](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas) your public key to be added. You *must* use a password if you're adding your own key.  

## Submitting work to JNSAMR
JNSAMR will be launched soon. In the interim period, please email it@nsamr.ac.uk if you want to submit to JNSAMR.
