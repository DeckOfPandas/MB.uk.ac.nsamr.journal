## Journal software and design
JSAMR is built using Open Journal Systems 3 (OJS 3): https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/
The codebase https://github.com/pkp/ojs is included as a submodule.

The "NSAMR" theme for OJS3 is child theme of the bootstrap3 extension of OJS3: https://github.com/NateWr/bootstrap3
The bootstrap3 codebase is included as a submodule.

NSAMR will contribute back to both OJS and bootstrap3, as well as to other Open Source frameworks used here.
