  abstract = {Pure tone intensity discrimination thresholds can be elevated by the
	introduction of remote maskers with roved level. This effect is on
	the order of 10 dB [10 log(DeltaII)] in some conditions and can be
	demonstrated under conditions of little or no energetic masking.
	The current study examined the effect of practice and observer strategy
	on this phenomenon. Experiment 1 included observers who had no formal
	experience with intensity discrimination and provided training over
	6 h on a single masked intensity discrimination task to assess learning
	effects. Thresholds fell with practice for most observers, with significant
	improvements in six out of eight cases. Despite these improvements
	significant masking remained in all cases. The second experiment
	assessed trial-by-trial effects of roved masker level. Conditional
	probability of a "signal-present" response as a function of the rove
	value assigned to each of the two masker tones indicates fundamental
	differences among observers' processing strategies, even after 6
	h of practice. The variability in error patterns across practiced
	listeners suggests that observers approach the task differently,
	though this variability does not appear to be related to sensitivity.},
